This app is built with React Router 7 on Cloudflare Workers.

## End-to-End Tests

The app uses Playwright for e2e tests. When implementing a feature, write concise e2e tests that check the feature's acceptance criteria. Prefer to combine tests that cover the same path through the app. Write tests that cover the feature's "happy path" as well as error scenarios.
