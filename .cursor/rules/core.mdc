This app is built with React Router 7 on Cloudflare Workers.

## Design Priorities

I should be able to make changes rapidly with confidence that I'm not breaking
anything. Prioritize:

- Modular architecture
- Strong typing
- Fast but thorough unit tests, if appropriate
- End-to-end tests for user-facing web interfaces
- Consistent lint & format rules

## Other Resources

- Manual ops instructions should be documented in docs/operations.
