# analytics

## Description

Privacy-friendly page view and event analytics via Plausible (or PostHog for
product analytics). The tracking script is loaded only in production and
excluded from authenticated app routes to avoid PII leakage. A
`track(event, props)` helper is available client-side for custom events (signup,
upgrade, feature used).
