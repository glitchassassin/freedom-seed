## Description

Append-only record of significant actions taken within an account (member added,
role changed, subscription updated, resource deleted, etc.). Each entry stores
the actor, action type, target resource, timestamp, and request metadata. The
log is exposed in team settings for admins and owners. Entries are never
modified or deleted, only appended.
