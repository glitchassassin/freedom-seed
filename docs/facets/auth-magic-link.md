# auth-magic-link

## Description

Passwordless login via a short-lived, single-use token delivered by email (or
SMS). The user enters their email, receives a link or 6-digit OTP, and is
authenticated on redemption. Tokens expire after 15 minutes and are invalidated
immediately on use. Pairs well with passkeys as a fallback recovery method.
