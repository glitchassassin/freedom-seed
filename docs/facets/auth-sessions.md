# auth-sessions

## Description

Manages the full lifecycle of authenticated sessions using signed HTTP-only
cookies. Covers session creation on login, rotation on privilege changes, idle
and absolute timeouts, and explicit revocation (logout / "sign out everywhere").
All session state is stored server-side (D1) so tokens can be invalidated
without waiting for expiry.
