# auth-social

## Description

OAuth 2.0 / OIDC login via third-party identity providers (Google, GitHub,
Apple). On first login, creates a linked identity record and optionally merges
with an existing account that shares the same verified email. Stores provider
tokens for downstream API access where needed. New providers are added by
registering an OAuth app and adding a driver entry.
