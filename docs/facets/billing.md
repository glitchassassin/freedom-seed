## Description

Stripe integration for subscription billing. Covers Checkout (new
subscriptions), the Customer Portal (plan changes, payment method updates,
cancellation), and inbound webhook handling for lifecycle events (payment
succeeded/failed, subscription updated/cancelled). A `stripeCustomerId` is
stored per workspace and synced on the first billing action.
