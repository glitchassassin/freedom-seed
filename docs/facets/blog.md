## Description

MDX-based blog for marketing content and changelog posts. Posts live in
`content/blog/` as `.mdx` files with frontmatter (title, date, author, excerpt).
The blog index and post detail pages are statically rendered at build time.
Cloudflare's CDN caches the output. A RSS feed is generated at `/blog/rss.xml`.
