# dark-mode

## Description

SSR-safe theme switching using a cookie to persist the user's preference (avoids
the flash-of-wrong-theme problem common with `localStorage`). A `theme` cookie
is read in the root loader and applied as a `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`.
A toggle component updates the cookie via a form action without a full page
reload.
