# email-templates

## Description

Typed, component-based email templates built with React Email. Each system email
(welcome, verify address, reset password, team invitation, billing receipt,
trial ending) lives as a `.tsx` file that renders to HTML and plain-text.
Templates are co-located with their trigger and share design tokens with the
main UI.
