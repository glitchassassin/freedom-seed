## Description

GDPR compliance primitives: a data export endpoint that generates a JSON archive
of all personal data for a user, a soft-delete account deletion flow that
anonymizes PII and schedules hard deletion after a 30-day grace period, and a
cookie consent banner shown to EU visitors. Consent choices are stored in a
cookie; analytics scripts are conditionally loaded based on consent state.
