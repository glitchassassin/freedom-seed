# invitations

## Description

Email-based flow for adding members to a team. An admin sends an invite
specifying the recipient email and intended role; the invitee receives a link
that creates (or links) their account and joins the team atomically. Invitations
are single-use, expire after 7 days, and can be revoked before acceptance.
Pending invitations are visible and manageable from team settings.
