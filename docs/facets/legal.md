## Description

Stub Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages rendered as static routes.
Content is maintained as plain markdown in `content/legal/` and rendered via a
shared layout. Links to both pages appear in the footer and during signup. Page
content must be customized per-product before launch — the stubs contain section
headings and placeholder text only.
