## Description

Client-side toast notification system for surfacing action feedback (success,
error, warning, info). Toasts are triggered from Route actions via a flash
cookie pattern — the action sets a short-lived cookie, the next page render
reads and displays it, then the cookie is cleared. This works across full
navigations as well as client-side fetcher submissions.
