## Description

Search engine visibility infrastructure: a `<Meta>` helper that routes export to
override page title, description, and Open Graph tags; an auto-generated XML
sitemap at `/sitemap.xml`; and a `robots.txt` route. Canonical URLs are set
consistently, and structured data (JSON-LD) stubs are provided for landing and
blog pages.
