# teams

## Description

Account/team abstraction that decouples resources from individual users. Every
user gets a personal team on signup; additional teams can be created and shared.
Resources (projects, data, subscriptions) belong to a team, not a user, enabling
hand-off and multi-seat access. Users may belong to multiple teams and switch
context via a team selector.
