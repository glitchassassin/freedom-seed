# ui-components

## Description

shadcn/ui component library: copy-paste Radix UI primitives pre-styled with
Tailwind. Components live in `app/components/ui/` and are owned by the project
(not a dependency), so they can be freely modified. Includes buttons, inputs,
dialogs, dropdowns, tables, badges, and form wrappers with Zod + Conform
validation integration.
